## How to Use

### **For Users**
1. **Access**: Visit the ClotSync home page
2. **Open Chatbot**: Click the floating ðŸ’¬ button (bottom right)
3. **Ask Questions**: Type your question in the input field
4. **Get Answers**: Receive instant, helpful responses
5. **Close**: Click the Ã— button to close the chat

### **Example Questions**
- "What is thalassemia?"
- "Am I eligible to donate blood?"
- "How often can I donate?"
- "Is blood donation safe?"
- "What are the blood groups?"
- "How does the donation process work?"

## Customization

### **Adding New Responses**
To add new FAQ responses, edit `faq.py`:

```python
FAQ_RESPONSES = {
    'your question': 'Your answer here',
    # ... existing responses
}
```

### **Styling Changes**
Modify the CSS in `templates/clotsync_chatbot_widget.html` to:
- Change colors and themes
- Adjust positioning
- Modify animations
- Update mobile responsiveness

### **Response Logic**
The chatbot uses pattern matching to find relevant answers:
1. **Exact matches** - Direct keyword matches
2. **Partial matches** - Word-based matching
3. **Question patterns** - What/how/why questions
4. **Default response** - For unrecognized questions

## Testing

### **Local Testing**
1. Start the Flask application
2. Visit the home page
3. Click the chatbot button
4. Ask test questions
5. Verify responses are appropriate

### **Common Test Questions**
- "Hello" â†’ Should get greeting response
- "What is blood donation?" â†’ Should get donation info
- "How often can I donate?" â†’ Should get frequency info
- "Random question" â†’ Should get helpful default response

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **Chatbot Not Appearing**
- Check if `clotsync_chatbot_widget.html` is included in `index.html`
- Verify the widget CSS is loading properly
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

#### **No Response from Chatbot**
- Verify the `/patient_chat_api` endpoint is working
- Check if `faq.py` is accessible
- Look for Python errors in the console

#### **Styling Issues**
- Ensure CSS is properly loaded
- Check for conflicting styles
- Verify mobile responsiveness

### **Debug Mode**
Enable debug logging by checking the Flask console for:
- API request logs
- FAQ handler errors
- Import errors

## Future Enhancements
